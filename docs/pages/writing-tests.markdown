In each test, you can use many test assertions.

 * `ut_assert`
 * `ut_assert_null`
 * `ut_assert_not_null`
 * `ut_assert_equal_int`
 * `ut_assert_equal_uint`
 * `ut_assert_equal_string`

## Custom assertions

You may find yourself in a situation where you need to write your own
assertion. There is support for doing that.

 * `ut_assert_func`
 * `ut_assert_func`
